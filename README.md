# Integrating Statistical and Machine Learning Approaches for Neural Coding
This is the repository for our paper titled "Integrating Statistical and Machine Learning Approaches to Identify Receptive Field Structure in Neural Populations" available on ArXiv. The pirpose of this study is to provide a pardigm, that incorportes statistical methods based on poin process generalized linear models (GLMs) to machine learning (ML) algorithms in order to classify neural population, that is statistically pincipled and computationally efficient.  

## Data
Data is available publicly on [CRCNS](http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K02N50G9) data sharing page. 

## Code
Our codes divided to Statistical Methods developed in MATLAB and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms developed in Python.
