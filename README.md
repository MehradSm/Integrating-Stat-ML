## Integrating Statistical and Machine Learning Approaches for Neural Coding
This is the repository for our paper titled "Integrating Statistical and Machine Learning Approaches to Identify Receptive Field Structure in Neural Populations" available on ArXiv. The purpose of this study is to provide a pardigm, that incorportes statistical methods based on point process generalized linear models (GLMs) to machine learning (ML) algorithms in order to classify neural population, that is statistically pincipled and computationally efficient.  

### Data
The data includes local field potential (LFP) and spiking data simultaneously recorded from hippocampus CA1 region of a male Long Evans rat performing a spatial alternation task on a W-shaped track. This data is available publicly on [CRCNS](http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K02N50G9) data sharing page. 

### Code
The codes are divided to Statistical Methods and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as follow:  
* The [statistical_models](https://github.com/MehradSm/Integrating-Stat-ML/tree/main/statistical_models) folder contains the required functions for the statistical analysis which are developed in MATLAB 
* The [ml_models](https://github.com/MehradSm/Integrating-Stat-ML/tree/main/ml_models) folder includes four machine learning (ml) classifiers developed in Python.
